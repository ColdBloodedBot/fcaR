Description: The aim of this package is to provide tools to perform fuzzy formal concept analysis from within R.
    It provides functions to load and save a Formal Context, extract its concept lattice and implications. 
    In addition, one can use the implications to compute semantic closures of fuzzy sets and, thus, build recommendation systems.
